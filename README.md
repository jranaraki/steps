# Steps
This application counts steps based on accelerometer data and calculates travelled distance based on computed stride length [1-2] using the user's demographic information. Inspired by [3] and [4].

## How it works
When a new accelerometer datapoint becomes available, it is fed into `calMag` function to calculate magnitude. Then, every one second, if at least 60 magnitude values are accumulated, the process of counting steps starts by calling `countSteps`. First, the average of the collected magnitudes is calculated and subtracted from each point. Then, the resulting values are compared with a constant value of eight, approximating the standard deviation of magnitude when walking. However, to have a more reliable result, an algorithm is required to detect walking and then calculate the standard deviation of the collected magnitudes over time.

## Notes
For the app to work correctly, the app should be prevented from suspension by following these steps:
- Open "UT Tweak Tool"
- Go to "Apps + Scopes"
- Click on "Steps"
- Activate "Prevent app suspension"

## Test cases
The app has been tested on Nexus 6P, Pixel 3A, Poco F1, Sony Xperia X and PinePhone.

## Limitation
The device should be in the pocket for the best accuracy.
